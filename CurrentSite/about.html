            <p>
                Hi, my name is Drake Farrokhi. I'm currently getting my master's degree in computer science with a specialization in artificial intelligence. I'm very exicted about the work that I will be doing
                as I believe the work being done in artificial intelligence is going to drastically change the world. Less about education as that's stuff you can always read about. I currently live in Vermillion,
                SD, a beautiful place with many nice people. I have a black cat named Malcolm who has redefined what "cat" means to me and likely some of my friends haha. I absolutely adore learning about new things
                and I tend to get myself wrapped up in them, currently it's chess, however I also enjoy trying to make video games, reading, hanging out with friends, and grabbing a beer after a long days work. When
                it comes to coding, I can use HTML, CSS, Python, and Java with python being my strongest coding language.
            </p>
